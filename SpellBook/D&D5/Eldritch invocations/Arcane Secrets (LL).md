_Prerequisite: 7th-level Warlock_  
You have unearthed a fragment of powerful arcane lore. You learn one spell of your choice from the Warlock spell list of 4th-level or lower, and you can cast once, at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. Once you cast it in this way you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

You can gain this Invocation more than once, but you must select a new Warlock spell each time you do, and you can only learn one Warlock spell per spell level in this way.
