_Prerequisite: 9th-level Warlock, Eldritch Familiar_  
You grant your Familiar a measure of your power. At the end of a long rest, choose one Warlock spell you know of 1st-level or higher. Your Familiar can cast it once, at a level equal to your Pact Magic spell slots without expending a spell slot.
