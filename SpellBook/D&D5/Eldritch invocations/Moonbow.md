**_Prerequisite: [The Archfey](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:archfey) patron, Pact of the Blade feature_**

You can create a longbow using your Pact of the Blade feature. When you draw back its string and fire, it creates an arrow of white wood, which vanishes after 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against lycanthropes with the bow. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage to the target per spell level.
