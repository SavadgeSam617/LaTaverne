**_Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature_**

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a warlock spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can knock the target prone if it is Huge or smaller.

#### Alternate Eldritch Smite

_Prerequisite: 7th-level Warlock, Eldritch Blade_  
Once per turn when you hit with an Eldritch Blade attack you deal bonus damage equal to one beam of your Eldritch Blast.

If your Eldritch Blast imposes extra effects, such as the reduced speed ofÂ _lance of lethargy_, it suffers those as well.
