**_Prerequisite: 5th level_**

When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.

#### Alternate One with Shadows

_Prerequisite: 5th-level Warlock_  
You learn the _invisibility_ spell, and can cast it once per long rest targeting only yourself without expending a spell slot so long as you are in an area of dim light or darkness.

At 9th level, it is no longer limited to once per long rest.
