**_Prerequisite: [The Great Old One](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:great-old-one) patron_**

The blue-white star Ulban maintains a fickle presence among the stars, fluttering into view only to herald a dire omen. As an action, you can turn invisible for 1 minute. If you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw, you become visible at the end of the current turn.
