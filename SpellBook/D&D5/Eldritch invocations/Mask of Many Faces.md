You can cast [[disguise self]]Â at will, without expending a spell slot.

#### Alternate Mask of Many Faces

Strange and sinister magics have made your form fluid. As an action, you can change your physical appearance and voice to match that of a creature that you have seen before, so long as the new appearance has the same arrangement of limbs. You determine the specifics, including your race, coloration, sex, height, weight, and hair length, but you cannot change sizes. Transforming does not affect your clothing or game statistics.
