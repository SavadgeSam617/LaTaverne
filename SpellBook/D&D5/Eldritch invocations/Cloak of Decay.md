_Prerequisite: 3rd-level Warlock_  
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a swarm of infernal flies, that extend out from you in a 5-foot radius. You must concentrate on this effect as if concentrating on a spell.

The flies grant you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Also, creatures that start their turn within the swarm take necrotic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0).
