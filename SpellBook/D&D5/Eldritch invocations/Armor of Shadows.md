You can castÂ [[Mage Armor]] on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

#### Alternate Armor of Shadows

As an action, you can ward yourself (or dismiss) armor made from living shadows. So long as you are not wearing armor or a shield, these shadows grant you an Armor Class equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier + your Dexterity modifier.
