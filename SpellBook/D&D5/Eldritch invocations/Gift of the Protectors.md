**_Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Tome feature_**

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a long rest.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.

#### Alternate Gift of the Deep Ones

You manifest aquatic features. You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, you learn the _water breathing_ spell, and you can cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
