This spell shuts down all electronic devices within range that are not wielded by or under the direct control of a creature. If an electronic device within range is used by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to prevent the device from being shut down. While the spell remains active, no electronic device within range can be started or restarted.
