You infuse a ring with elemental power, choosing acid, cold, fire, poison, or lighting, and a command word.

When the wearer casts a spell of 3rd-level or lower that deals the chosen damage type, it can speak the command word to deal maximum damage to one target of the spell.

Once the wearer uses this ring to maximize the damage of a spell it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

At 17th level, it can be used on spells of 5th-level or lower.
