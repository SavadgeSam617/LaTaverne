This magical belt has ten Tiny pockets which can each hold a Tiny or smaller object. As an action, bonus action, or as part of an attack, the wearer can call to mind one object in one of
the pockets, instantly summoning it into its hand and can use it as part of that action, bonus action, or attack.

If the wearer does not have a free hand when it summons the object, it shunts one object it is holding into that pouch.
