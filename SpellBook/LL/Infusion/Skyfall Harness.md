6th level artificer

This magic harness automatically sizes to fit the wearer, and can be worn over clothing or light armor. It has wing-like fins between your limbs that can slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall, and aren't incapacitated, you subtract up to 100 feet from your fall when calculating falling damage, and can move 2 feet horizontally every 1 foot you fall.
