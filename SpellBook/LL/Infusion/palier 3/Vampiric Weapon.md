10th level artificer

You enchant a weapon to drain life from enemies. When the wielder scores a critical hit with this weapon, the target takes an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, so long as the target is
not a construct or undead. The wielder gains temporary hit points equal to the extra necrotic damage dealt.

When you reach 14th level, the additional necrotic damage from this Infusion increases to 4d6.


# ALTERNATE
11th-level Artificer

When the wielder hits a creature with this weapon, it deals a bonus 1d6 necrotic damage on hit, and the wielder can gain temporary hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This
weapon has no effect against undead or constructs.

At 17th level, this bonus necrotic damage becomes 2d6.
