11th-level Artificer

You imbue this object with a greater amount of arcane power, choosing a 2nd-level Artificer spell you know to infuse within. Any creature that holds this item can expend one Charge to
cast the imbued spell with your Artificer spellcasting ability. If the imbued spell requires concentration, the wielder of the item must concentrate on the spell for the duration.
This magical item has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.
