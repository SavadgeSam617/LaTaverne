These magic pouches all share one interdimensional space with the capacity of a single pouch. Reaching into an infused pouch allows access to this shared storage space. A pouch
operates as long as it is within 100 miles of another pouch; the pouch is otherwise empty and won't accept contents.

If the Infusion ends, the items stored in the shared space all move into one of the pouches, determined at random.
