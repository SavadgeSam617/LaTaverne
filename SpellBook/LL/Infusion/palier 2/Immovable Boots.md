If the wearer is standing on a flat surface, it can use an action to activate the boots, fixing itself in place with magic. Until it uses an action to deactivate the boots, they do not move, even if they are defying gravity. 

To move the boots and their wearer, a creature must succeed on a DC 30 Strength check.
