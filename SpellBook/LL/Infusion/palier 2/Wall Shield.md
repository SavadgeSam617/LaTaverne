5th-level Artificer

As an action, the wielder can slam this magic shield into the ground, expending Charges to produce the effects of wall of stone centered on the shield, which remains in the ground.
However, this effect only creates a number of panels equal to the Charges spent, it doesn't require concentration, and lasts for 1 minute. The wall is destroyed if the shield is removed.
This magical shield has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.

At 11th level, this magic shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This Armor Class bonus increases to +2 at 17th level.
