Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 5th-level Blood Hunter

As a bonus action , you invoke this Rite to force one creature that you can see within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute.
It can repeat this Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

###### Empowered Corrosion
The effects of this Blood Rite last until the creature succeeds on the Constitution saving throw. Moreover, whenever it fails this Constitution saving throw, it takes necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Rite Die.
