Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 9th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you can touch a creature that has died within the last minute, snatching its soul back from the grave, and returning it to life with 1 hit point. However, when a creature
is brought back to life by this Rite it gains a permanent death saving throw failure. This side effect can only be removed by greater resoration or a spell of similar, or greater, power.
This Rite cannot return a creature to life that died of old age, and it cannot restore a creature's missing body parts.

###### Empowered Open Grave
The creature does not gain a permanent death saving throw failure, but instead suffers a
single level of exhaustion, which is healed by a long rest.
