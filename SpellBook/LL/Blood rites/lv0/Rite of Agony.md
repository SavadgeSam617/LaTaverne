Type: Blood rites

As a bonus action, you invoke this Rite and force one creature that you can see within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws, and each time it makes an attack it takes necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Rite Die. These effects end at the end of your next turn.

###### Empowered Agony. 
The effects of this Blood Rite last for 1 minute. The creature repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on a success.
