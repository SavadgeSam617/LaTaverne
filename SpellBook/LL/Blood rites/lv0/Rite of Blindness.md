Type: Blood rites
---
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet hits another creature you can see with an attack, you can use a reaction to invoke this Rite. The attacker subtracts one roll of your Rite
Die from its attack roll, potentially turning a hit into a miss.

###### Empowered Blindness
The creature must also subtract one roll of your Rite Die from every weapon and spell attack
roll it makes until the end of that creature's following turn.
