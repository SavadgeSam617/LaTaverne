Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 13th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you invoke this Rite to force a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw as you corrupt its blood. On a failure, it takes necrotic damage equal to four rolls of your Rite Die, its speed is halved, and it cannot take reactions. It can repeat this Constitution saving throw as an action. On a success, the effects of this Rite end, but on a failure, it takes additional necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Rite Die and suffers one level of exhaustion.


###### Empowered Decay
This Rite ignores necrotic resistance and treats necrotic immunity as resistance. Also, any creature killed by this Rite is reduced to a pile of flesh-colored dust.
