As an action, you invoke this Rite to force a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw, infecting its mind with nightmarish phantasms. On a failed save, the
creature takes psychic damage equal to four rolls of your Rite Die and is frightened of you for 1 minute.

The creature repeats this Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effects of this Rite end, but on a failed save, the creature takes additional psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Rite Die.

###### Empowered Nightmares
The creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 for the duration of this Rite's effects.
