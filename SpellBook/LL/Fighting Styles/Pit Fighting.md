You have trained to fight with weapons typically associated with gladiators, granting you the following benefits:

- For you, tridents deal 1d8 (1d10) piercing damage on hit.
- When making an attack roll with a net against a creature within 5 feet, you do not have disadvantage on the roll.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, making an attack with a net only takes the place of one attack.
