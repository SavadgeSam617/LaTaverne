Choose either Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill, and when you make an ability check with that skill, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to grant
yourself advantage on the roll. If you are already proficient in that skill, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice. You can select this Metamagic ability more than once, but
you must select a different skill proficiency each time.
