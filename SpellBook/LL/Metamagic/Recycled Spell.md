When you cast a spell you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it in a way that conserves your arcane power. If the spell deals no damage, misses its target, or otherwise fails to take effect, you can use your reaction to regain half the Sorcery Points you spent to cast this spell (rounded down), including the Sorcery Point you spent on this Metamagic.
