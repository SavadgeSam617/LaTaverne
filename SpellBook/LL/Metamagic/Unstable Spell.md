When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to have the initial saving throw target an ability score determined by random
chance. Roll a d12, and the spell's initial saving throw is changed to target the ability score from the list below. 
If you roll a 1, your spell immediately fails. However, only the 2 Sorcery Points you spent to use this ability are wasted. You regain any Sorcery Points you used to cast the spell.


| Roll | Saving Throw  |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 1    | Spell Failure |
| 2-3  | Strength      |
| 4-5  | Dexterity     |
| 6-7  | Constitution  |
| 8-9  | Wisdom        |
| 10   | Intelligence  |
| 11   | Charisma      |
| 12   | Your Choice   |
