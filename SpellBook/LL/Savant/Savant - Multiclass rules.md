If your group uses the optional multiclassing rule, here is everything you need to know if you choose to take at least one level in the Savant class.

### Ability Score MinimumÂ 
As a multiclass character, you must have a minimum Intelligence score of 13 in order to take a level as a Savant, or to take a level in another class if you are already a Savant.

### Proficiencies Gained

If Savant is not your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first Savant level: light armor, one skill of your choice from the Savant skill list, and one set of artisan's tools of your choice.
