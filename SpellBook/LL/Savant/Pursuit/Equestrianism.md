_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You have learned to tend to horses and other trained mounts. You gain proficiency in Animal Handling, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

When you are riding a trained mount, your mount shares your initiative in combat and acts during your turn. Whenever it makes an ability check, damage roll, or saving throw, it can add one roll of your Intellect Die to its roll, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command your mount to attack, or to use another action from its stat block.

Finally, if you spend 8 hours training a friendly quadruped creature and spend 50 gold on necessary training materials and food, it is considered to be a trained mount for you.
