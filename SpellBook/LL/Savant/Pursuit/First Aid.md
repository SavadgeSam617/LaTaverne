_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You have learned basic medicinal techniques to aid your allies. You gain proficiency in Medicine, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

During a long rest, you can spend 1-hour using a Healer's Kit to produce a number of _potions of healing_ equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Any unused _potions of healing_ expire 24 hours after you created them.
