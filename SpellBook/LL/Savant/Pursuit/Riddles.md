_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You have spent a great deal of time learning to speak in both riddles and rhymes. You gain proficiency in Deception. When you make a Charisma (Deception) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Also, when you speak, you can choose to speak in Riddles. When you do so, you appear to be speaking normally, but you include hidden messages laced in your rhyming words.

Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can teach a creature with an Intelligence of 11 or higher to understand your Riddles and respond in kind.
