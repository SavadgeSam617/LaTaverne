You have dedicated a significant amount of your studies to  
the art of education. Over the course of 1 hour, you can teach  
one creature that can hear and understand you one skill, tool, or weapon proficiency, or one language you know.

The creature gains proficiency in that tool, skill, or weapon, or learns to speak that language until it completes a long rest.
