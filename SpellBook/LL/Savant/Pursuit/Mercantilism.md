_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You are an astute scholar of economics, trade routes, and the marketplace. You gain proficiency in Insight, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

While you are trading with a creature whose Intelligence and Wisdom are both lower than your Intelligence, items you purchase from that creature cost 10 percent less, and items you sell are purchased for 10 percent more than usual.
