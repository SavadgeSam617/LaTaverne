_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You are a dedicated scholar of various holy texts and sacred rituals. You gain proficiency in Religion, and whenever you make an Intelligence (Religion) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

You also learn to speak, read, and write Celestial. Finally, you learn the _ceremony_ spell, but you can only cast it as a ritual. For you, the ritual only takes 10 minutes, and you can cast it without the material components once per long rest.
