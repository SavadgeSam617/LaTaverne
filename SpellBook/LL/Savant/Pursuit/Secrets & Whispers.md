You have a knack for knowing where to eavesdrop and the right person to bribe. You gain proficiency in Stealth. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Whenever you spend a long rest in a settlement, you can spend 1-hour gathering local rumors to learn of a significant, even secret, event which occurred in there in the last week.
