_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You can use your knowledge of nature to thrive in the wilds. You gain proficiency in Nature, and whenever you make an Intelligence (Nature) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Over the course of 10 minutes, which can be during a short or long rest, you can gather natural material and use a dagger or handaxe to create one of the following objects: a club, 1d4 darts, a javelin, a net, 10 feet of rope, or a _Bushcraft Snare_.

As an action, you can set a _Bushcraft Snare_ in an adjacent, unoccupied, 5-foot space. The first Large or smaller creature to move into the space must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Intellect save DC or be restrained by the _Snare_.

As an action, a creature can make a Strength check against your Intellect save DC, escaping from the _Snare_ on a success.
