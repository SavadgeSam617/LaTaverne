You learn exceptionally fast. You gain proficiency in one skill or tool, or learn to speak and read a language of your choice.

Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can replace this proficiency or language with another proficiency or language of your choice, so long as you have an example to learn from, such as a teacher or manual.
