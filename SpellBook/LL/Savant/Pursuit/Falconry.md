_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You have spent many months learning to train birds of prey. You gain proficiency in Perception, and whenever you make  
a Wisdom (Perception) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

You gain a trained Falcon which uses the Hawk statblock from theÂ _Player's Handbook_, but it has an Intelligence score of 8. You and your Falcon can communicate simple ideas with each other using simple gestures and sounds. Your Falcon is unwaveringly loyal to you and obeys your commands.

In combat, your Falcon shares your initiative and acts on your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action. If you are incapacitated, your Falcon acts on its own.

If your Falcon falls to 0 hit points it makes death saving throws as a player character would. Should your Falcon die, your special skills allow you to track and train another Falcon over the course of an 8-hour period using 5 gp worth of bait.
