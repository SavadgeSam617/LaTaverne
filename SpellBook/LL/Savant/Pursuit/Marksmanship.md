_Prerequisites: 4th-level Savant_  
You bring your intellect to bear in the use of ranged weapons. You gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand. Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

You also gain proficiency with all martial ranged weapons, and whenever you make a ranged weapon attack, you can use your Intellect Die in place of the weapon's damage die.

Finally, if your setting includes firearms, and your Savant has been exposed to the inner workings of such devices, they are considered proficient with simple and martial firearms.
