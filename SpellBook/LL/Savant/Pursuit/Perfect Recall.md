You can recall picture-perfect details from things that you commit to memory. If you spend at least 1 minute observing an object or creature, you can perfectly recall any observable information about that creature or object point in the future.

For example, you could perfectly memorize a map, a page from a tome, a work of art, or the appearance of a creature.
