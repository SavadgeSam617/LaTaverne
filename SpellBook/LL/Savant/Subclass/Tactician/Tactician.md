All successful monarchs, conquerors, and revolutions have a master Tactician who is responsible for their success. These leaders are always one step ahead of their foes and a plan for every eventuality. They know maneuvers that lead to victory, and those that end in ruin. Alone, a Tactician is no threat, but with powerful allies, they become a formidable fighting force.
