_10th-level Tactician Discipline feature_  
Your genius allows you to control the flow of each battle from the outset. When you roll initiative, you can issue an Order to  
one creature before any other creatures have a chance to act.

Also, when another creature that can hear you makes an  
attack against your Focus, you can use Potent Observation  
to add a roll of your Intellect Die to its attack roll. You can  
do so after it rolls, but before you know if its attack hits.
