_3rd-level Culinarian Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in Nature and cook's utensils. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in Nature you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

In addition, so long as you have access to cookâ€™s utensils and edible ingredients, any creature that expends a Hit Die  
to regain hit points during a short rest with you also regains additional hit points equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.
