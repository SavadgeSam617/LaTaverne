_3rd-level Culinarian Discipline feature_  
You are compiling a Cook Book which contains the exotic Recipes you discover during your adventures:

_**Recipes Known.**_ You know two Recipes of your choice from [[SpellBook/LL/Savant/Subclass/Culinarian/Culinarian Creature Recipes|Culinarian Creature Recipes]]

_**Adding a Recipe.**_ As an action, you can harvest a Sample from a creature that died within the last minute. Before the end of your next long rest, you can spend 1 hour, which can be during a short or  
long rest, using cook's utensils and the Sample to add the corresponding Recipe that corresponds to the Sample's creature type to your Cook Book.

_**Preparing a Morsel.**_ At the end of each short or long rest, you prepare a number of Morsels equal to your Intelligence modifier. Each Morsel you prepare has the properties of one Recipe from your Cook Book.

You don't need samples from a creature corresponding to a Recipe to prepare a Morsel with that Recipe. Any Morsels you prepare lose their potency at the end of the next short or long rest as they become inedible and bland.

_**Serving Morsels.**_ As an action, any creature can eat a Morsel, or feed it to a willing creature within its reach. A creature that eats a Morsel gains the benefits detailed in the Recipe description. A creature can only benefit from one Morsel at a time, and eating another Morsel instantly ends any previous Morsel benefits.

_**Replacing a Cook Book.**_ If your Cook Book is lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 hour adding each of your old Recipes to a new Cook Book from memory. You do not need to rediscover any Recipes that were lost.
