_15th-level Culinarian Discipline feature_  
You are a master monster chef and can cook with anything, anywhere. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use cook's utensils and any foods to prepare a monstrous feast that can feed yourself and a number of other creatures equal to your Savant level.

If a creature spends 10 minutes eating its meal, it is instantly cured of any poisons, diseases, or any other hostile condition that is effecting it, and for 24 hours, it is immune to both the frightened and poisoned conditions, and it adds one roll of your Intellect Die to any ability check or saving throw it makes that uses its Wisdom or Constitution.
