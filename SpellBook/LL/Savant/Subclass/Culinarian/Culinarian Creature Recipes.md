##### Creating your own Recipes

Part of the genius of a Culinarian is the creation of custom signature Recipes. If you have an idea for a Recipe based on a creature type that isn't included here, work with your DM to design a suitable effect based on the abilities of a creature of that type.

Whatever Recipe you design, its effects should last for 1 hour and should be equal in power to the other available Recipes that a Culinarian can add to their Cook Book at that prerequisite level.
