_10th-level Rune Scribe Discipline feature_  
Your Runes offer a measure of protection to those that bear them. If a creature bearing at least one of your Runic objects is forced to make a saving throw to resist the effects of a spell or another magical effect, they gain a bonus to their roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (medium of +1).

Moreover, each time you finish a long rest, you can replace one Rune you know with another Rune of your choice.
