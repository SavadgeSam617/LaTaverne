Legends say that rune magic is the most ancient arcane art to have been mastered by mortals. Savants that dedicate their lives to the study of these Runes are known as Rune Scribes. They learn all they can about these ancient sigils that embody the magic of creation. The magic of runes isn't widely known, and its secrets are jealously guarded by those who master it.
