_3rd-level Rune Scribe Discipline feature_  
You have learned the artful and ancient magic of Runes.

# _**Runes Known.**_
You learn two Runes of your choice from the list at the end of this Discipline. Some Runes have a Savant level prerequisite, which you can learn as soon as you reach that Savant level.

You learn one additional Rune of your choice at 6th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level in this class.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Runes you know with another Rune of your choice.

# _**Inscribing a Rune.**_ 
Over the course of 1 hour, you can use your calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a Rune you know into a weapon, suit of armor, or an object that you can wear or hold. A creature that wears or wields a Runic object gains the benefits of the inscribed Rune.

Each of the Runes you know can only be inscribed in one object. Inscribing a Rune again dispels any previous inscriptions.

# _**Invoking Runes.**_ 
If the creature bearing one of your Runic objects speaks the language the Rune is inscribed in, it can Invoke the Rune to gain its benefits.

Once a Rune has been Invoked, it cannot be Invoked again until the Rune Scribe who inscribed it finishes a long rest, even if the Rune is inscribed onto a different object.

# _**Runic Casting.**_ 
You can cast and concentrate on spells from your Runes, even when you have a Focus. If a Rune requires a target to make a saving throw, it does so against your Intellect save DC. If a Rune requires an attack roll, the the Invoking creature uses its Intelligence as follows:

**Runic attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
