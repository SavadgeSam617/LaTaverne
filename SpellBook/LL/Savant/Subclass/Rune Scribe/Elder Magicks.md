_6th-level Rune Scribe Discipline feature_  
The power imbued within your Runes has grown. Your Runic objects count as magical for as long as the Rune is inscribed.

Also, during the course of a short rest, you can perform a short 10-minute ritual to reawaken the magic of a Rune that has already been Invoked for the day, and it can be Invoked one additional time before the end of your next long rest.
