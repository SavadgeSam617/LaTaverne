_3rd-level Rune Scribe Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency with Arcana and calligrapher's supplies. Whenever you make a check with either proficiency you gain a bonus to the roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in Arcana you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

You also learn to speak, read, and write two of the following Runic Languages, which are used to inscribe the Runes you learn: Draconic, Druidic, Dwarvish, Giant, or Primordial.
