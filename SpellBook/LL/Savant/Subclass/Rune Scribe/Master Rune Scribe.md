_15th-level Rune Scribe Discipline feature_  
You can draw on the magic of your Runes to protect yourself in times of great need. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can draw on the power of a Runic object within 60 feet of you, instantly dispelling the Rune and any of its effects, and you fall to 1 hit point instead of 0.
