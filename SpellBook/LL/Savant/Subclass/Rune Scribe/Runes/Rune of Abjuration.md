_Prerequisite: 6th level Rune Scribe_  
_Item: a cloak, robe, shield, or suit of armor_  
Once per turn, the bearer of this Runic object can reduce the damage from a spell or another magical effect by an amount equal the Rune Scribe's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

_**Invoking this Rune.**_Â When a creature within 30 feet of the bearer of this Runic object casts a spell, the bearer can use its reaction to Invoke this Rune and force the creature that cast the spell to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the triggering spell fails and has no effect.
