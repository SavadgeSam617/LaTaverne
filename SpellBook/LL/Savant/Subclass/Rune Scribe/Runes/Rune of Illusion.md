_Item: a cloak, robe, or suit of armor_  
As an action, the bearer of this Runic object can change its physical appearance to match that of a creature it has seen before, so long as it has the same arrangement of limbs as the bearer. The bearer can determine the specifics of these changes, including race, coloration, hair length, sex, height, and weight, but it cannot change its size. This illusion does not affect clothing, equipment, or game statistics.

The illusion can be detected with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs. the Rune Scribe's Intellect save DC.

_**Invoking this Rune**_Â As an action, the bearer of this Runic object can Invoke this Rune to turn invisible for 10 minutes. This invisibility ends if they attack or force a saving throw.
