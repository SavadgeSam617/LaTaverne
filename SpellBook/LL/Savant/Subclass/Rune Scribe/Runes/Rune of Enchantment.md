_Item: a bracelet, diadem, necklace, or ring_  
Creatures will treat the bearer of this Runic object one stage friendlier than normal. For example, an indifferent creature might treat the bearer as a friend, or a hostile creature might treat the bearer indifferently. This special treatment instantly ends if the bearer attacks the creature.

_**Invoking this Rune.**_ As an action, the bearer can Invoke the Rune to cast either the _calm emotions, charm person_ or _command_ spell, targeting a number of creatures equal to the Rune Scribe's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 creature).
