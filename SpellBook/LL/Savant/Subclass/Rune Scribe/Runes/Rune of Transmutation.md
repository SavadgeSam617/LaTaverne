_Prerequisite: 10th-level Savant_  
_Item: a bracelet, diadem, ring, or necklace_  
The bearer of this Runic object gains its choice of a 30-foot swimming speed, a 30-foot climbing speed, or has its walking speed increased by 10 feet. As a bonus action, the bearer can switch its current benefit for another from the above list.

_**Invoking this Rune.**_ As an action, the bearer can Invoke this Rune to transform itself into a beast with a CR equal to the Rune Scribe's Savant level or lower, but otherwise using the rules of the _polymorph_ spell. However, unlike _polymorph_, this transformation does not require concentration.
