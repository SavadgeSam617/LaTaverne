_10th-level Physician Discipline feature_  
Your techniques push allies to their physical limit. When you use a Combat Medic ability you can empower it as described below. You can use an empowered ability on each individual creature once with no negative effects for it. However, each subsequent time you use an empowered ability on a creature before it finishes a long rest, it gains 1 level of exhaustion.
