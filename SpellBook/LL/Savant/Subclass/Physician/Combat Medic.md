_3rd-level Physician Discipline feature_  
You have trained to administer medical aid to others, even in the midst of battle. When you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one Healer's Kit and cause it to regain a number  
of uses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

Also, your knowledge of medicine grants you the Combat Medic abilities below, each of which takes an action to use.

Whenever you use one of these Combat Medic abilities, you can expend one use from a Healer's Kit you are holding to use the maximum Intellect Die result, instead of rolling.
