_3rd-level Physician Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in Medicine and Sleight of  
Hand. Whenever you make a check with either of  
these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll  
equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are  
already proficient in either skill you instead gain  
proficiency in another skill from the Savant list.

Moreover, your medical training and insight  
into anatomy grants you the benefits below:

- Whenever you would make a Wisdom  
    (Medicine) check, you can make an  
    Intelligence (Medicine) check instead.
- If you spend 1 minute examining your Focus, you  
    can identify any disease, poison, or curse affecting it.
- Once per turn, if you hit your Focus with a weapon  
    attack, you can reduce its speed by a number of feet  
    equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum  
    of 5 feet) until the beginning of your next turn.
