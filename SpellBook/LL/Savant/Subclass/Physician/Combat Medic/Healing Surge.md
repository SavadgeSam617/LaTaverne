You touch another living creature and it can expend one of its Hit Dice to regain a number of hit points equal to its Hit Die roll + its Constitution modifier + one roll of your Intellect Die.

If you use this ability on a living creature at 0 hit points, it is instantly stabilized even if it does not expend a Hit Die.
