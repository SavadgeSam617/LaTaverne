If you use Dress Wounds on a living creature for 10 minutes without interruption, you can reattach any severed limbs or digits, and it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the difference between its current and maximum hit points.

However, the temporary hit points from this feature are instantly dispelled if the creature regains any hit points.
