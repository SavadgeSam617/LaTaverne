Physicians use their considerable intellect to heal the  
sick and tend to the wounded. They spend their lives  
studying the anatomy and biology of mortals, and use this knowledge to keep their allies in top condition and cripple foes. Using this medical training, they offer aid to those that do not have access to the luxury of divine magic or other healing spells.
