Bending their impressive intellect toward the study of music, Virtuosos are known for the impressively complex music they write and perform. These masterful composers know how to manipulate the emotions of their listeners with themes, and, with the right sequence of notes, they can fill a listener with feelings of sorrow, anger, indifference, or absolute adoration.
