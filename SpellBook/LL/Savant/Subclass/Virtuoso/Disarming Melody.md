_6th-level Virtuoso Discipline feature_  
You have woven threads of disarming music into your Theme. If a creature under the influence of your Theme attacks you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or attack another target of its choice within range. If there isn't another target in range its attack misses. Any creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Additionally, whenever you use your action to begin your Theme or your bonus action to continue the Theme, you can target one creature under its influence with a burst of sound, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes thunder damage equal to two rolls of your Intellect Die.
