_3rd-level Virtuoso Discipline feature_  
You have composed powerful Themes that stir the hearts of any creature that can hear them. As an action, you can begin to play this Theme, which continues until the start of your next turn, unless you choose to end it (no action required).  
If you are already playing your Theme, you can use a bonus action to extend its duration until the start of your next turn.

Your Theme can be heard up to 120 feet away, but it only influences creatures within 30 feet that can hear the Theme.

If one of your Theme's effects requires a creature to make  
a saving throw, it does so against your Intellect save DC.

While you are performing your Theme, you can use your reaction to alter its sound in the following ways:
