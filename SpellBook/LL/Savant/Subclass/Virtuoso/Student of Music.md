_3rd-level Virtuoso Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in Insight and Performance. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Your intuitive understanding of musical composition and performance also grants you the benefits below:

- Whenever you would make a Performance check you can choose to use your Intelligence in place of your Charisma.
- You gain proficiency with three musical instruments.
- If you spend 1 hour practicing with a musical instrument, you are considered proficient with it. However, only one instrument can benefit from this feature at a time.
- Whenever you make an ability check that incorporates a musical instrument that you are proficient with, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
