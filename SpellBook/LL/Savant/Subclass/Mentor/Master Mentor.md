_15th-level Mentor Discipline feature_  
Your advice is legendary and is desired throughout the land. Creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you gain a bonus to all ability checks and saving throws equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1), so long as they can hear you.

Moreover, whenever you target an allied creature with the Help action or Astute Advice, you can grant it temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

Lastly, you regain the use of your Mystical Intuition feature whenever you complete a short or long rest.
