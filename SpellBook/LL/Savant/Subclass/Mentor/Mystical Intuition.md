_10th-level Mentor Discipline feature_  
Your life experience and extraordinary intuition can give you mystical insights into the world around you. You can spend 1 minute meditating on a question you have, or a question that another creature has asked you. At the end of the meditation, you mystically intuit the answer to the question as if you had cast the _commune_ spell. However, unlike _commune_, you can only intuit an answer if it is known to another mortal being.

Once you gain an answer to a question using this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

Finally, you regain all expended uses of your Astute Advice feature whenever you complete a short or long rest.
