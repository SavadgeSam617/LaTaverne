_3rd-level Mentor Discipline feature_  
You know just what to say to help your allies learn from their failures. Whenever another creature that can hear you within 30 feet misses with an attack roll, or fails an ability check or saving throw, you can use a reaction to have it re-roll the d20, adding one roll of your Intellect Die to the result.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all  
    expended uses when you finish a long rest.
