While most Savants use their vast intellect in pursuit of their chosen discipline, those known as Mentors use their intellect in the service of others. Most often, Mentors are past their prime and are looking to pass their knowledge on to the next generation. Whether you are an elder in your community, a retired adventurer, or just someone with knowledge beyond your years, you are ready to gently guide those around you.
