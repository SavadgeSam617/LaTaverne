_3rd-level Mentor Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in both History and Insight. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Your knowledge of life also grants you the benefits below:

- You master the _Instruction_ Scholarly Pursuit. If you have already mastered this Scholarly Pursuit, you can instead master your choice of _Perfect Recall_ or _Quick Study_.
- Whenever you use _Instruction_ you can teach the chosen language, skill, tool, or weapon to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier, instead of just one.
- When you use Potent Observation or Wondrous Insight and you roll a 1, you can re-roll your Intellect Die. You must use this new roll, even if you roll another 1.
