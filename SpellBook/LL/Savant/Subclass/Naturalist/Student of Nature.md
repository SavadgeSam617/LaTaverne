_3rd-level Naturalist Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in both Nature and Survival. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Also, whenever you make an Animal Handling or Survival check you can use your Intelligence in place of Wisdom.
