The Naturalist's classroom begins at the edge of civilization. They are scholars of the wilderness, and will go to great lengths to preserve nature as it exists, free from the influence of civilization. A true Naturalist is a conservationist of the wild and an expert at predicting weather, identifying toxic and medicinal plants, caring for animals, and guiding others safely through the wilderness.
