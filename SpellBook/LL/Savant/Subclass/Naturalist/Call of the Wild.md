_10th-level Naturalist Discipline feature_  
As an action on your turn, you can force one beast, plant, or monstrosity within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Intellect save DC, so long as it can hear you. On a failure, it is charmed by you for 1 hour. Creatures that have an Intelligence score equal to half your Savant level or higher automatically succeed on this saving throw.

While a creature is charmed, it is friendly to you and your allies. As a bonus action, you can issue a verbal command to the creature, which it does its best to obey on its next turn. Once it completes your command it defends itself to the best of its ability until you command it again with a bonus action.

If the creature takes damage, it repeats its Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of its next turn, ending this charm on a success. When it does so, you can use a reaction to shout at it and subtract one roll of your Intellect Die from its roll.

Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw against this feature it is immune to it for 24 hours. You can only have one creature charmed in this way, and charming another creature ends this effect for any other charmed creatures.

Once you successfully charm a creature you must complete a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
