_6th-level Naturalist Discipline feature_  
You are a master tracker of wild creatures and any that would threaten them. You can designate a creature as the Focus of your Adroit Analysis by analyzing signs of its passing, such as tracks or marks, even if you can't see the creature. Creatures also remain your Focus even if they become hidden from you.

You also master the _Physical Fitness_ Scholarly Pursuit. If you have already mastered this Scholarly Pursuit, you instead master your choice of either _Falconry_ or _Perfect Recall_.
