_10th-level Naturalist Discipline feature_  
Your knowledge of the wild does not stop with the mundane. You can add specific dragons, giants, oozes, and undead to your [[Naturalist's Journal]]. For example, you could add notes on a young blue dragon, fire giant, or ghast to your Journal.

Your cutting-edge understanding of the natural world also grants your Naturalist's Journal the following extra benefits:

_**Creatures.**_ You treat the specific creatures in your Journal as if they were your Focus, even if they are not currently designated as the Focus of your Adroit Analysis.

_**Environments.**_ You, and up to ten other creatures that are traveling with you can ignore the effects of magical difficult terrain and have advantage on their saving throws to resist the hostile effects of any of the environments you have detailed in your Journal.
