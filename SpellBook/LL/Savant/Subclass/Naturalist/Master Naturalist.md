Your knowledge of the natural world surpasses that of nearly all other scholars. You can add specific creatures of any type, except for constructs and humanoids, to your Journal.

Also, the duration of [[Call of the Wild]] increases to 8 hours, and creatures detailed in your Journal have disadvantage on their initial save to resist [[Call of the Wild]].

Finally, you have advantage on attack rolls against any creatures detailed in your Journal.
