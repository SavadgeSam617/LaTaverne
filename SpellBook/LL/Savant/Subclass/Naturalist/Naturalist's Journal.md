_3rd-level Naturalist Discipline feature_  
You compile your research on fantastical flora and fauna in a Naturalist's Journal. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can take notes in your Journal, detailing your current environment or a specific beast, plant, or monstrosity (such as a bear or griffon) that was your Focus within the last 24 hours. If your Journal is lost, you can spend 1 hour adding each old entry to a new Journal from memory.

You have advantage on all Intelligence checks related to all environments and creatures detailed in your Journal.

Finally, once per turn when you make an attack roll against a creature that is detailed in your Journal, you gain a bonus to your attack roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.
