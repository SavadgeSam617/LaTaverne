_10th-level Archaeologist Discipline feature_  
You constantly study every myth, legend, and folk tale  
you come across. If you observe a person, place, or object  
for at least 10 minutes, you mystically recall information  
about it as if it were the target of a _legend lore_ spell.

The target of this feature does not need to be of legendary importance in order for you to gain information. Though, if there is no relevant lore about the target you learn nothing.

Finally, when you use a magic item, you use your Intellect save DC for its effects unless the item's save DC was higher.
