_3rd-level Archaeologist Discipline feature_

You gain proficiency in History and Investigation. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Also, if you spend 1 minute examining an object you are touching, you can ascertain its value, origin, and age. If it has magic properties, you learn them as if you had castÂ _identify_.
