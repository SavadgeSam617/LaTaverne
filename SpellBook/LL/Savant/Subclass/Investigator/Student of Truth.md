_3rd-level Investigator Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in Insight and Investigation. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Your intuitive nature grants you the following benefits:

- Whenever you make an Insight or Perception check you can choose to use your Intelligence in place of Wisdom.
- When you take the Search action, you gain information as if you spent a full minute searching instead of one action.
