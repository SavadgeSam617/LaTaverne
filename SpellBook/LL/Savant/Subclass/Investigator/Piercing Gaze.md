_10th-level Investigator Discipline feature_  
Your gaze sees through the most intricate deceptions and conspiracies. You instantly detect the presence of illusions and shapeshifters, and you are instantly aware if your Focus is lying to you.

Also, if your Focus fails its saving throw against [[Rough & Tumble]], you can cause it to be stunned for the duration in place of the normal effects.
