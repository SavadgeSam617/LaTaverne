_6th-level Investigator Discipline feature_  
Your intuition grants you a heightened sense for openings in your foe's defenses. When you use [[Calculated Flourish]] and cause the attack to miss, you can force the attacker to make a Dexterity saving throw against [[Rough & Tumble]] as part of the same reaction, instead of moving.

Also, whenever your Focus fails the saving throw against Rough & Tumble, you can choose for it to take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Finally, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike attack as a bonus action.
