Masters at unraveling mysteries, conspiracies, and secrets of all kinds, Investigators possess an uncanny ability to read the intent of others. They often dedicate their lives thwarting any who deceive the innocent and take advantage of the common trust. Their considerable intellect and eye for the truth stand in the way of thieves, shapeshifters, and corrupt politicians.
