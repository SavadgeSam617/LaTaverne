_3rd-level Investigator Discipline feature_  
You have gained some unsavory skills while fighting shadows in the underbelly of civilization. You learn to speak, read, and decode Thieves' Cant, the language of the criminal world.

Also, your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Intellect Die + your Strength modifier on hit.

When you hit your Focus with a melee attack on your turn, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Intellect save DC. On a failure, it is either blinded, deafened, or it cannot speak until the start of your next turn, or if the target is Large or smaller, you can choose to knock it prone.

### At 10th-lv
Also, if your Focus fails its saving throw against  Rough & Tumble, you can cause it to be stunned  for the duration in place of the normal effects.
