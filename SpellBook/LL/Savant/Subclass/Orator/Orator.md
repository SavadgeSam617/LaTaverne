Orators are true masters of linguistics and the  
spoken word. These wordsmiths use nothing but  
their wit and mastery of rhetoric to rebuff foes and  
empower their allies. With utmost confidence, they  
stride boldly into hostile situations, confident that  
they can win anyone with their eloquence.

Unlike those who use their charm to cajole, Orators  
embolden their allies and win over their enemies with nothing but reasonable logic and convincing rhetoric.
