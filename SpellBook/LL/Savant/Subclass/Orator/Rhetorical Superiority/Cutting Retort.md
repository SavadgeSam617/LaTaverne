When a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an attack, you can use your reaction to distract it with a cutting remark. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or subtract one roll of your Intellect Die from the triggering attack roll.

Once a creature succeeds on this Wisdom saving throw,  
it is immune to the effects of this ability it for 24 hours.
