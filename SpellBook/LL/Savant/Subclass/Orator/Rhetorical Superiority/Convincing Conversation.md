If you spend at least 1 minute talking with a creature that is not hostile toward you, you can force it to unknowingly make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed by you for 1 hour, or until you or your allies do anything harmful to the charmed creature or any of its allies.

You can have only one creature charmed this way at a time. Charming another target ends this effect for other creatures.
