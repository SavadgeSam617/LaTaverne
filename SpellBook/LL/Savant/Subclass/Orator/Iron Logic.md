_6th-level Orator Discipline feature_  
Your masterful grasp of logic allows you to resist all but the strongest mind-altering effects. You have advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make to resist enchantment spells, and you are immune to the charmed condition.

Also, whenever you use Uplifting Remark, the creature  
can roll the Intellect Die twice and use the higher result.
