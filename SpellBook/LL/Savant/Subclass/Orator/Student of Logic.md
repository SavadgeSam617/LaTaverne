_3rd-level Orator Discipline feature_  
You gain proficiency in both Deception and Persuasion, and whenever you make a check with either proficiency you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

Your mastery over words grants you the benefits below:

- Whenever you make a Deception or Persuasion check  
    you can use your Intelligence in place of Charisma.
- You master your choice of the _[[Instruction]], [[Riddles]]_,  
    or _[[Traditions]]_ Scholarly Pursuit, even if you do not  
    meet the normal level prerequisite for that Pursuit.
- You learn to speak, read, and write a number of extra languages equal to your Intelligence modifier.
