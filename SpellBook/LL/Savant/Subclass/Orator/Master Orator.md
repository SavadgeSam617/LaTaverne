_15th-level Orator Discipline feature_  
Your absolute mastery over the spoken word allows you to bend all but the strongest creatures to your will. When you force a creature to make a saving throw to resist one of your Rhetorical Superiority abilities or Peerless Rhetoric, it has disadvantage on the roll if both its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are lower than your Intelligence score.
