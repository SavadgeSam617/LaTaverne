_0th-level Orator Discipline feature_  
You can bend the masses to your will with your words. If you speak to a group of creatures who can hear and understand you for 1 minute, you can choose to inspire or persuade a number of creatures in that crowd equal to your Savant level, as detailed below. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this ability on a crowd again.

_**Inspire.**_ Creatures gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Savant level, and while the temporary hit points remain, creatures have advantage on saving throws to resist enchantment spells and are immune to being frightened.

_**Persuade.**_ Creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Intellect save DC or be charmed by you for up to 24 hours as if by the _[[mass suggestion]]_ spell.
