You gain proficiency in both Arcana and Religion. Whenever you make a check with either of these proficiencies you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the Savant skill list in its place.

- Whenever you make an ability check to communicate with a creature that is not native to the material plane you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.
- You can also learn the following characteristics about your Focus with Adroit Analysis: its alignment, its native plane of existence, or its spellcasting ability (if it has one) and the level of the highest spell that it can cast.
- You learn to speak, read, and write either Celestial, Infernal, Primordial, or Sylvan.
