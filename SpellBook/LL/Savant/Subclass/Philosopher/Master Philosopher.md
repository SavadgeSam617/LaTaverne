_15th-level Philosopher Discipline feature_  
Your willpower rivals that of powerful extraplanar beings. You are always under the effect of _[[SpellBook/D&D5/1st LV/Protection form Evil and Good|Protection form Evil and Good]]_.

Also, whenever a creature takes psychic damage from one of your _Words of Power_, it takes additional psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
