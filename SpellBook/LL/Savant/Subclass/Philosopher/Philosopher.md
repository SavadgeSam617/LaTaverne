Philosophy is considered by many to be the purest Discipline a Savant can pursue. They expend their genius pondering the deep questions of existence; the purpose of life, the nature of the multiverse, and the relationships between mortal beings and gods. Through the study of the multiverse, Philosophers try to perfect mortal knowledge of the true nature of reality.
