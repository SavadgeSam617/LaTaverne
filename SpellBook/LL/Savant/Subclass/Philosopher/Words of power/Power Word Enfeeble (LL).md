As an action, you force your Focus to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned for 1 minute.

It can choose to repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, this effect ends, but, on a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Intellect Die.
