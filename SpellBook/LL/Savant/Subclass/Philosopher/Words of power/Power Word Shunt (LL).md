As an action, you can force your Focus to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is shunted from the current plane for up to 1 minute. If it is native to the current plane, it is banished to a harmless demiplane. If it is not native to the current plane, it is banished to its native plane of existence.

It can choose to repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it returns to the space that it was shunted from, or the closest unoccupied space. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Intellect Die.
