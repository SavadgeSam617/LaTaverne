_6th-level Philosopher Discipline feature_  
Your resolute sense of purpose bolsters your _Words of Power_. You can speak your _Words of Power_ at any creature that can hear you within 30 feet, instead of just your current Focus.

Moreover, if you speak a _Word of Power_ at your Focus, it takes additional psychic damage equal to one roll of your Intellect Die on a failed save, and half as much psychic damage on a successful save.
