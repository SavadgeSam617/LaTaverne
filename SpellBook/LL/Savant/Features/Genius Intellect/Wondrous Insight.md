When another creature that can hear you makes an ability check using a skill or tool that you are proficient in, you can use your reaction to grant it a bonus to its roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. You can do so after it rolls the d20.

When you use Wondrous Insight on another creature's ability check you roll your Intellect Die twice and use the higher roll.
