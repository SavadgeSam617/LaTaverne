When a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to add one roll of your Intellect Die to your Armor Class against that attack. If this Flourish causes the attack to miss, you can move up to 10 feet as part of the same reaction without provoking opportunity attacks.

## At 11th lvevel
If your reaction causes the attack to miss, you can make one melee attack against your attacker as part of your reaction.
