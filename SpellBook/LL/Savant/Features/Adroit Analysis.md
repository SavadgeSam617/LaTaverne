You can focus your mind to analyze your foe. Beginning at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to analyze one creature you can see within 60 feet, designating it as your Focus. While it is your Focus, you gain the following benefits against it:

- When you hit it with an attack, or if you observe it for 1 minute, you learn one of the following characteristics of your choice: its highest ability score, lowest ability score, Armor Class, speed, creature type, or one special sense.
- You can use your Intelligence, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for weapon attack and damage rolls against it.
- Once per turn when you hit it with an attack, you deal 1d6 bonus damage. The bonus increases as you gain levels, to match the Intellect Die column of the Savant table above.
- Any attacks it makes against you have disadvantage.

It remains your Focus until you choose to end this effect (no action required), or it is hidden from you, if you designate another creature as your Focus, or if you are incapacitated.

While you have a Focus, you cannot cast or concentrate on spells or use other features that require your concentration.
