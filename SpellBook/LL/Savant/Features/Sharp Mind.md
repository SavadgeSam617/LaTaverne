Your ability to analyze your surroundings is unrivaled. Also at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to take the Help or Search actions, or make an Intelligence ability check to recall information about a creature or object you can see.

Moreover, you can use the Help action to aid a creature in attacking your Focus, so long as you are within 5 feet of the attacker, even when you are not within 5 feet of the target.
