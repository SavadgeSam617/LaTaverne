You are always prepared for danger. Beginning at 7th level, so long as you aren't incapacitated you cannot be surprised and you add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

Also, when you roll initiative you can use Adroit Analysis to designate a creature you can see within range as your Focus.
