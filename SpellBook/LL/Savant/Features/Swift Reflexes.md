The speed that you observe and react to your surroundings is incredible. Beginning at 5th level, you have a second reaction you can take each round, but only one reaction per trigger.

At certain Savant levels you gain additional reactions, you gain a third reaction at 13th level and a fourth at 18th level.

En résumé :

| LV  | TOTAL de réaction |

| 13  | 3                 |
