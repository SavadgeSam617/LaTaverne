Never satisfied with your current state you are always looking to expand your educational horizons. At 1st level, you master one Scholarly Pursuit. If a Pursuit allows you to add one roll of your Intellect Die to an ability check that already has this benefit, you roll your Intellect Die twice and use the higher result instead.

You master one additional Scholarly Pursuit of your choice when you reach 4th, 7th, 13th, and 18th level in this class.
