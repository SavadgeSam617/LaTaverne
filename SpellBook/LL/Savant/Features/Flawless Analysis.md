Beginning at 17th level, you can use your action to flawlessly predict your Focus's next move and alert your allies. Until the start of your next turn, your Focus has disadvantage on every ability check, attack roll, and saving throw. Also, creatures of your choice that can hear you have advantage on any saving throw your Focus forces them to make until your next turn.

Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
