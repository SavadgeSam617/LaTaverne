### Magnificent Minds

There are many wonderfully intelligent people in the world, but few are true Savants. Born with the innate desire to learn anything they can, and the potential for genius-level intellect, Savants spend their lives learning anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognizable at an early age, a Savant's unquenchable hunger for knowledge draws them to the great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. They are willing to go to any lengths to unlock the secrets of the world, often turning to lives of adventure. For  
a Savant, no price is too steep for the promise of discovery.

### Intense Focus

Savants are hyper-focused on their chosen area of study and often become obsessed with learning all they can about their specialty. In their quest for discovery, Savants are willing to set aside any conviction, political, religious, or otherwise, to acquire the information they seek. To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to any ideology.

Often at great personal cost, Savants will not stop their research until they have made a revolutionary discovery in their area of study. It is not unusual to encounter one such scholar far from the safety of a university and its libraries.

### Creating  Your Savant

When creating a Savant, consider their upbringing and the level of their formal education. Were they a star pupil at the finest university gold could buy? Or, were they a child of the streets, fighting for every scrap of knowledge that they could get their hands on? Maybe their mind was trained from birth to be the perfect analytical tool for a noble house or family.

Also, consider why your Savant would rely on only their intellect rather than use their gifts in pursuit of the arcane or in the service of a higher power. Are they cursed to never be able to produce even the most mundane spell? Or, have they sworn never to rely on the magic that destroyed their family?

Finally, why did your Savant become an adventurer rather than live the life of an academic? Have they advanced beyond normal study and look forward to the endless discoveries of adventure? Or, have they always been a student of the world?
