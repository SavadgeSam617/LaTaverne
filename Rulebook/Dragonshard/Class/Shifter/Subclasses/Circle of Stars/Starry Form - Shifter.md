At 2nd level, you gain the ability to harness constellations' powers to alter your form. Once per long rest, when you use your bonus action to shapeshift into a new form, you may choose to take on a starry version of the wild aspect.

Your starry form has the same statistics as your shapeshifted form, but your body becomes luminous;
your joints glimmer like stars and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, while in this form, you may choose to deal radiant damage with your natural melee weapons. The starry form ends after 10 minutes, reverting to the non-starry version of your current form. Alternatively, the form ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or shapeshift into 
a new form.
Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body:
- **Pegasus**. A constellation of a pure, winged horse appears on you. While in this form, you may use your bonus action to restore a number of hit points equal to one roll of natural weapon die plus your wisdom modifier. You may do this a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once).
- **Scorpius**. A constellation of a vicious scorpion appears on you. While in this form, creatures that move to a location inside your reach provoke an opportunity attack from you (regardless of whether or not that creature began its movement inside your reach).
- **Ursa**. A constellations of a great bear appears on you. When you enter this form, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your wildshifter level plus your wisdom modifier.
