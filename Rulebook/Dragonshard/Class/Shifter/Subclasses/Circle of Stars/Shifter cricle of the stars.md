Like sailors who relied on the stars of the night sky to navigate their way across vast waters, wildshifters of the stars likewise embark on epic journeys using the guidance of
constellations.
Members of this circle revere the stars and the knowledge that their patterns bring to light. While druids of the circle focus their efforts on tracking these patterns to glean knowledge, wildshifters are called on journeys by the influence of starlight where they are led to greater wisdom through the experiences they have. When their journeys are complete, wildshifters return to the circle and the insight they gained is correlated with the patterns of the sky to gather all knowledge into one congruous whole.
