Beginning at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of the [[conjure animals]] spell as if it were cast at 9th level. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no
concentration, or until you dismiss it.
Once you use this feature, you can not use it again until you complete a long rest.
