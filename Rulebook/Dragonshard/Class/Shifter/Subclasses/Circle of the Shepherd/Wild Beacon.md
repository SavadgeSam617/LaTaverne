Beginning at 2nd level, whenever you shapeshift you attract beast spirits that assist you and your allies. Once per short rest, when you shapeshift into one of your wild aspects, you
may choose one of the minor forms you are now benefiting from. Spirits of that animal flood into the area, granting the benefits of the chosen minor form to all creatures of your choice within 30 feet.
These spirits persist for one minute, after which the chosen creatures no longer benefit from the minor form.
