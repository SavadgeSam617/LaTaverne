Even more so than other circles, the circle of the shepherd focuses their efforts on the protection and conservation of animal species, ensuring that their homes and habitats
remain undisturbed. Members of this circle commune with the spirits of beasts and are content in the company of animals and wild spirits.
Wildshifters from the circle of the shepherd find themselves constantly in the presence of beast spirits. By virtue of their empathetic bond with nature, these wildshifters act as a beacon, attracting the spirits of nature to protect and aid them, especially when they call upon their power to shapeshift.
