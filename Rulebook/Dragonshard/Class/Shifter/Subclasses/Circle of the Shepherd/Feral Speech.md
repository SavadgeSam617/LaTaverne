At 6th level, you learn to communicate with all beasts of the wild. Regardless of your current form, you can communicate with beasts as if you shared a language. Beasts you
communicate with are still limited by their inherent intelligence. Most lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past.
In addition, you gain proficiency in animal handling if you are not already proficient. If you already have proficiency, you add your proficiency bonus twice when you make an animal handling check.
