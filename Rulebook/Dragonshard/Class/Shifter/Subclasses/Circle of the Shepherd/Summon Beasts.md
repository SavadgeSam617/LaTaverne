Beginning at 10th level, you can more deliberately control your bond with animal spirits to summon them in your time of need. Once per long rest, you can use your action to cast
the [[conjure animals]] spell at 5th level. When you reach 14th level, you can cast the spell at 7th level.
The spell requires maintaining concentration and lasts up to one hour, as if it were cast normally.
