Due to the circle of the moon's proclivity towards transformation and shapeshifting, wildshifters are more common in this circle than any other. Moon wildshifters have elaborate control over their wild aspects allowing them to combine and benefit from more aspects at once.
More strongly attuned to their animalistic side than others, wildshifters from the circle of the moon tend to be more reclusive from society, often spending weeks or months prowling and scouting their lands for threats.
