Beginning at 6th level, you are able to mend some of your wounds through your shapeshifting. When you use your bonus action to shift forms, you restore an amount of hit
points equal to one roll of your natural weapon die. You may do this a number of times between long rests equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once).
