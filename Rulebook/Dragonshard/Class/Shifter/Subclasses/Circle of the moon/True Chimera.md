Beginning at 14th level, you draw up on the greater powers of two beasts at once combining them into a true amalgamation of their appearance and abilities.
When you use your bonus action to shapeshift into one of your wild aspects, you may choose one of your bonus minor forms granted by the chimeric form feature. You benefit from the major form of the chosen aspect in addition to the wild aspect you are shapeshifting into, effectively granting you two major forms at once. Your shape changes to become a bizarre combination of the two aspects and you take on the size of whichever major form is larger (if applicable).
