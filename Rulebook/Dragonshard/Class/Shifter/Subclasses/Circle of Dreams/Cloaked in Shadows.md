At 14th level, you learn to hide yourself in the shadowy powers of the Gloaming Court when you shapeshift. Once per short rest, when you use your bonus action to shapeshift
using the wild aspect or thousand faces features, you may choose to make your new form invisible for one minute. Your invisibility ends early if you shapeshift into a new form.
