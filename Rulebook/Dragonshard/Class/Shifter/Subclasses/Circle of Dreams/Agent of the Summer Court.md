At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You become a source of fey energy that can disrupt and disorient evildoers.
When you touch a creature, whether through a melee attack or otherwise, you may use your reaction to force that creature to make a wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature is disoriented by dreamy visions and is blinded until the end of your next turn. You may do this a number of times between long rests equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once).
