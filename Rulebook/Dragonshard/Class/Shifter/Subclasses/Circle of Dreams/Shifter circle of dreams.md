The circle of dreams has close ties with the Feywild and good-aligned Fey. The goals of the circle center on filling the world with dreamy wonder where the wounded can find healing and the weary can find rest. However, such a world is impossible while the wicked are allowed to roam, and so the wildshifters of the circle are charged with finding and rooting
out these sources of evil.
