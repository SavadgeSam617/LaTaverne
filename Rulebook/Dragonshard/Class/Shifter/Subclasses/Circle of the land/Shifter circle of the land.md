Members of the circle of the land have a deep connection to the lands in which they were born, granting them a powerful connection to the ambient magics of nature. Even wildshifters in the circle develop spellcasting to augment their shapeshifting.
Wildshifters of this circle are devoted protectors of their homelands, working with their fellow druids and wildshifters to safeguard communities that follow the Old Faith.
