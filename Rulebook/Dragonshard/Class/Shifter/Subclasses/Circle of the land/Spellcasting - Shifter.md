At 2nd level, you draw upon your connection to the land in which you became a wildshifter to cast spells. Choose that land â€“ arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark.
###### Cantrips
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.
You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
###### Spell Slots
The Wildshifter of the Land Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.


###### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 2nd level, you know three 1st-level druid spells of your 
choice.
The Spells Known column of the Circle of the Land Wildshifter Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must 
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 8th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. At 7th, 13th, and 19th levels, your 
new spell must come from the druid circle of the land spell list associated with your chosen land.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. If you are replacing the spell learned at 7th, 13th, or 19th levels, the new spell must come from the spell list associated with your chosen land.


###### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your wisdom modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

# Spell Save DC
= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
# Spell attack modifier 
= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
