At 2nd level, you learn to harness the power of fire in your shapeshifting. Once per long rest, when you use your bonus action to shapeshift into a new form, you may choose to take
on a fiery version of the wild aspect.

Your fiery form has the same statistics as your intended shapeshifted form, but you emanate fire, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, while in this form, you may choose to deal fire damage with your natural melee weapons. The form ends after 10 minutes, reverting to the normal version of your current form. Alternatively, the form ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or shapeshift into a new form.
While in this form, whenever you are hit with an attack within 5 feet, the attacking creature takes fire damage equal to one roll of your natural weapon die.
