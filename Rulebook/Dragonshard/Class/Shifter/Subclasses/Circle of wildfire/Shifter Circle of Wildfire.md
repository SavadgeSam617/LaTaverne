Wildfire wildshifters are agents of destructive power to clear the way for new creation and life. Their circle understands that destruction is a necessary prerequisite for the creation of
new life and is part of the natural cycle of the living world.
These wildshifters can transform into fiery beasts, destroying and incinerating threats to their land, whether it be diseased life, biological debris, or unnatural beings, to allow for the healthy renewal of nature.
