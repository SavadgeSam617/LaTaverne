Beginning at 6th level, you learn to produce fiery attacks regardless of your current form. When you hit a creature with a natural weapon attack, you may choose to deal fire damage
or your normal damage type.
In addition, you gain resistance to fire damage, and your attacks ignore resistance to fire damage.
