Beginning at 10th level, your fire consumes the forms of the dead to bestow new life. While in your fiery form, when a small or larger creature dies within 10 feet, you may choose
to incinerate its body as a reaction. When you do so, you heal a number of hit points equal to two rolls of your natural weapon die plus your wisdom modifier.
You may do this a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once) between long rests.
