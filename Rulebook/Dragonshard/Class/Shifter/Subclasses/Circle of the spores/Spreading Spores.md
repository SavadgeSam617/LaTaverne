At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action, you can begin to exude spores in a 15-ft radius around yourself. The center of the affected area remains on you as you move and lasts for up to one minute or until you dismiss the spores as a bonus action. 
Whenever a creature moves into the affected area or starts its turn there, that creature takes your halo of spores damage unless that creature succeeds on a constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier) or you choose to exempt that creature. A creature cannot take this damage more than once per turn.
While the cube of spores persists, you cannot use your halo of spores reaction.
