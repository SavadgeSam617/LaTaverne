Wildshifters of the circle of spores are physically bound to the powers of decay and the cycle of life and death. Their shapeshifting extends not only to animal forms, but also the ability to generate deadly spores.
Those that would violate the sacred cycle of life and death by unnaturally avoiding their final rest or seeking to replace life with undeath, risk facing the lethal, life-draining power of these wildshifters.
