Beginning at 2nd level, you passively generate invisible spores from your form that you can unleash on unsuspecting targets.
When a creature you can see moves to within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal necrotic damage equal to one roll of your natural weapon die plus your wisdom modifier to that creature unless it succeeds on a constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier).
