At 15th level, your shapeshifting ability becomes far more versatile. You gain the ability to change your appearance at will, as a bonus action.

Your altered appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs and be roughly the same size as your current form. Performing this feature does not require expending a use of shapeshifting.
