At 5th level, you learn to draw upon two of your wild aspects at a time. When you shapeshift into one of your wild aspects (using either the "wild aspect" or "wild form" features), you may choose one of your other wild aspects and gain the benefits of its minor form as well, influencing your shapeshifted appearance in minor ways.

As you gain levels, you learn to integrate more wild aspects into your form. You may choose total of two additional minor forms at 9th level, three at 13th level, and four at 17th level.
