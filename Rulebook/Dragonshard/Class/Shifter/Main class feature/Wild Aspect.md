As a wildshifter, you develop a close connection with certain beasts of the wild and gain the ability to magically shift your form to partially imitate theirs. At 1st level, choose three aspects (see the Wild Aspects section) and one bonded animal that corresponds to each. You gain additional wild aspects according to the Wildshifter table. 
As a bonus action, you can choose one of your aspects, partially shapeshift into the corresponding bonded creature, and gain the benefits of that aspect's minor form, replacing any current aspects. When you do so, you simultaneously change your natural wildshifter weapons to one appropriate to your new form. This transformation can include growing horns, scales, fur, long teeth, or other features of your bonded creature's appearance that you choose. 
You may shapeshift a number of times between short or long rests equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You can revert to your normal form as a bonus action without expending a use of your shapeshifting. Also, once you have access to major forms (see the Wild Form feature), you can choose to drop the major form while retaining the minor form benefits in this same manner.
###### Natural vs Metal Armor
Like druids, wildshifters will not wear armor made of metal. The manufactured nature of metal armors inhibits a wildshifter's ability to transform into their animal aspects. While wearing metal armor, you cannot benefit from your aspects' minor or major forms.
Armors derived from plant or animal material, such as leather or hide, are useful to wildshifters as they can be integrated into an aspect's major form without difficulty. You can benefit from your aspects' forms and the AC granted by these armors at the same time.
