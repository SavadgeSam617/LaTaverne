Beginning at 3rd level, your attunement to wild beasts makes you more adept at interacting with the creatures of nature.

You have advantage on skill checks involving interactions with beasts. If a beast is one of your wild aspects (or is closely related at your DM's discretion), you automatically add double your proficiency bonus to those checks regardless of your normal proficiencies.

In addition, while you are shapeshifted into the major form of a creature, you can communicate with that kind of beast as if you shared a language.
