At 3rd level, you learn to fully shapeshift into a beast. When you use the wild aspect feature to shift into one of your wild aspects, you may choose to transform into your bonded creature, gaining the benefits of the aspect's major and minor forms. The following rules apply to your shapeshifted form:

- You retain your own statistics (including hit points and the ability to speak), except for those noted below and in the specific aspect description.
- Your appearance changes to that of your bonded creature, and your creature type becomes [[beast]].
- You may change your size by up to one step from your normal size, unless stated otherwise for the specific aspect.
- You cannot cast spells or wield weapons/shields. You can continue to use your natural weapons and unarmed strikes.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Armors derived from plant or animal material can easily be integrated into your shapeshifted form, granting you the benefits of the armor while in your new form.
