As a bonus action, you can magically shapeshift weapons inspired by beasts for use in combat, such as claws, horns, or fangs. These weapons have the following properties:
- The weapons count as natural melee weapons with the finesse property, with which you are proficient.
- The weapons deal 1d4 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you shapeshift). This die changes as you gain wildshifter levels, as shown in the Natural Weapon Die column of the Wildshifter table.
On your turn, when you attack with natural weapons, including those gained by racial features, you can make one more attack with those weapons as a bonus action.
