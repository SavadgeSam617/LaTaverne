Beginning at 7th level, your malleable form helps you avoid area effects, such as a dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
