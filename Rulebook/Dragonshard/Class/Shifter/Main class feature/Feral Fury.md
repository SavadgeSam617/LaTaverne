Beginning at 11th level, you take inspiration from the feral techniques used by your favored beasts. When you take the attack action with natural weapons on your turn, you may choose to attack wildly. When you do so, you may attack two additional times with your attack action, but you have disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of your turn.
