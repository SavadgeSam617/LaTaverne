# Minor Form
Your size increases by one step. In addition, you gain a bonus to athletics checks made to shove other creatures and to resist being grappled or shoved equal to your wisdom modifier.

# Major Form
Your [[size]] is large or huge (your choice). On your turn, if you move at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and hit it with your next attack, that creature is automatically knocked [[prone]] if it is smaller than you. In addition, you have a +2 bonus to damage rolls against [[prone]] creatures with your melee attacks.
