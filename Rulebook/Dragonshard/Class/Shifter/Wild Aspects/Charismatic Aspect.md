*Example Creatures: Chameleons, Peafowl, Dart Frogs*
Some creatures exert their presence with spectacular colors and charisma, making themselves impossible to ignore.

# Minor Form
You gain a +2 bonus to your charisma score. In addition, you gain a bonus to performance checks involving creatures that see you equal to your wisdom modifier.

# Major Form
You have advantage on performance checks. In addition, once per round, you can replace one of your attacks with a dazzling display to distract a creature that can see you within 30 feet. When you do so, you make a performance check and your target makes a wisdom check. If your check is higher, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn.
