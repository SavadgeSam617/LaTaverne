Those with this aspect are famously stubborn, refusing to fall from grievous wounds.

# Minor Form
When reduced to 0 hit points, you may choose to gain a level of [[exhaustion]] instead of falling [[unconscious]]. If you choose to do so, you do not fall [[unconscious]] from having 0 hit points until the end of your next turn.

# Major Form
Your speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, when you enter this form, you gain temporary hit points equal to your wildshifter level plus your wisdom modifier. You may only gain these hit points once between short or long rests. If you complete a short or long rest in this form, you immediately regain the temporary hit points.
