# Minor Form
Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage, and you make opportunity attacks with advantage.

# Major Form
You gain a climb speed equal to your base speed. In addition, a number of times per short rest equal to your wisdom modifier, when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may force that creature to make a constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier). On a failure, that creature is [[stunned]] until the end of your next turn.
