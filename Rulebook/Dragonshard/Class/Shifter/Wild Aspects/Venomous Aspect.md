*Example Creatures: Platypuses, Snakes, Spiders*
Venomous creatures debilitate their prey with poisoned attacks, weakening them before the kill.

# Minor Form
Your melee attacks with natural weapons deal an additional 1 point of poison damage. This damage increases to 1d4 at 7th level, 1d6 at 13th level, and 1d8 at 17th level.

# Major Form
When you hit a creature with a melee attack, they must make a constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a creature is
[[poisoned]] and may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this poison for 24 hours.
