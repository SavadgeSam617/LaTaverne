The aspect of the opportunist invokes shockingly threatening attacks against those that dare approach.

# Minor Form
Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.

# Major Form
You make opportunity attacks with advantage. Your melee attacks with natural weapons deal an additional 1 point of damage (poison or the original damage type, your choice). This damage increases to 1d4 at 7th level, 1d6 at 13th level, and 1d8 at 17th level.
Beginning at 15th level, you gain [[tremorsense]] with a range of 15 feet.
