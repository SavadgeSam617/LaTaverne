The aspect of the darting flight offers the ability to make quick, subtly effective attacks at foes.

# Minor Form
If you entered the reach of a creature on your turn, you may freely leave that creature's reach without provoking an attack of opportunity.

# Major Form
You gain a flight speed of 40 feet that can be used for a number of minutes equal to your wisdom modifier between short or long rests. In addition, if you move at least 30 feet on your turn, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn.
Beginning at 10th level, you can fly indefinitely in this form.
