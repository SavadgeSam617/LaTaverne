The aquatic hunter aspect grants mastery over underwater pursuits and the powerful ability to track and kill wounded prey.

# Minor Form
You gain the ability to detect injured creatures within 120 feet by scent. When a creature missing at least one hit point is within 120 feet of you, you are aware of their presence but do not know their exact location or exactly what creature they are.

# Major Form
Your walking speed is replaced by a swim speed of 30 feet.
You can breathe underwater indefinitely.
In addition, you have advantage on attack rolls made against targets that are missing at least half of their hit points.
