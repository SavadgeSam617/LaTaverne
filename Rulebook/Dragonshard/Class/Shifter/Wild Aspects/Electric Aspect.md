# Minor Form
Your melee attacks with natural weapons deal an additional 1 point of lightning damage. This damage increases to 1d4 at 7th level, 1d6 at 13th level, and 1d8 at 17th level.

# Major Form
Your normal speed is replaced by a swim speed of 30 feet. You can breathe underwater indefinitely. In addition, when you are hit by a melee attack within 5 feet, your attacker automatically takes the lightning damage from the minor form.
