The aspect of constitution invokes a juggernaut of tireless endurance and furious power. Those who take this aspect are known for surviving severe wounds and delivering punishing blows in return.

# Minor Form
You gain a +2 bonus to your constitution score. This increases your current hit points and hit point maximum by an amount equal to your current level. If you lose the benefits of this minor form, your current hit points and hit point maximum decrease by the same amount.

# Major Form
You reduce any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage by an amount equal to your wisdom modifier. In addition, you can reroll the damage die for melee attacks you make, but you must use the new result when you do so.
