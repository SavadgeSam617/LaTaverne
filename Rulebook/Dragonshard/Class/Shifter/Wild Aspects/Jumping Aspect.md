The aspect of the jumping grants great mobility in leaping through the air.

# Minor Form
You have advantage on acrobatics checks. In addition, your standing and running long jump covers a distance equal to twice your strength score. Similarly, your standing and running high jump clears a distance equal to 6 + double your strength modifier. In this form, jumping costs only one foot of movement for every two feet you travel.

# Major Form
You may use your bonus action to disengage by leaping away from your opponents, moving yourself a distance less than or equal to your standing jump in any direction.
