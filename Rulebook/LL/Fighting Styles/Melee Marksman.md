Having a hostile creature within 5 feet of you doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attacks, so long as you are attacking a creature within 5 feet.

When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet, you can use your bonus action to make a melee attack against it with your ranged weapon. On hit, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.
