You have some basic martial arts training, giving you some skill in both unarmed combat and unarmed defense.

- So long as you aren't wearing armor or a shield, your Armor Class equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
- Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier on hit.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn and only make unarmed strikes, you can make a single unarmed strike as a bonus action on that same turn.
