You have been trained to survive, track, and explore in the wild, much like a Ranger. You gain the benefits listed below:
- Increase either your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
- You learn one Knack of your choice from those available to the Alternate Ranger. If the Knack requires you to roll a Quarry Die, you roll a d4 unless your Quarry Die is higher. If the Knack forces a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.
