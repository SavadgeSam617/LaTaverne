While you may not be a true Sorcerer, within you dwells a small spark of arcane power. You gain the benefits below:

- You learn one cantrip and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list, and Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for all three spells.
- You gain two Sorcery Points which you can expend to cast either of the spells that you learned from this Feat, or any other Sorcerer spells you know. If you already have Sorcery Points, these are added to your existing pool of Sorcery Points. You regain your Sorcery Points each time you finish a long rest.
