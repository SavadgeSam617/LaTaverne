*Prerequisite: Wisdom of 13 or higher*

You have forged a bond with an animal companion that will adventure by your side. Choose a [[beast]] of CR 1/8 or lower to be your Wild Companion. This Companion is friendly to you, and it obeys your commands to the best of its abilities.
Your Companion uses its normal stat block, but it learns to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
You and your Companion can communicate simple ideas to each other using a series of clicks, whistles, and gestures. It gains all the normal benefits of both short and long rests.
In combat, your Wild Companion acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it will only take the Dodge action on its turn unless you use a bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block or another action. If you are incapacitated, your Companion will defend itself to the best of its ability. If you die, your Companion will do everything in its power to flee and return to its home.
If your Companion dies, you can spend 8 hours tracking and training a new Wild Companion, but only if a suitable beast of CR 1/8 or lower can be found in your local area within an 8-hour period.
