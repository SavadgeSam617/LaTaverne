You have trained extensively with ranged weapons to become a master marksman. You gain the benefits listed below:

- Attacking a target within a ranged weapon's long range does not impose disadvantage on your attack roll.
- Your attacks with ranged weapons can ignore half-cover, and treat three-quarters cover as half-cover.
- You can use a bonus action to give yourself advantage on your next ranged weapon attack roll on your current turn.
