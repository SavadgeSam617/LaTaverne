Your savage battle instincts let you exploit even the smallest weakness. You gain the following benefits:
- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the damage dice and use whichever total roll is higher.
- When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack you roll one additional weapon damage die.
