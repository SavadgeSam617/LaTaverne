You have spent many quiet hours honing your spirit to better control your physical body. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain the benefits of one Sacred Focus from those available to the Shaman Class at 1st level. If you already benefit from a Sacred Focus, you cannot select it again.
