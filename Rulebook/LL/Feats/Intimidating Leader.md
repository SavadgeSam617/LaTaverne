*Prerequisite: proficiency in Intimidation*

You use fear and intimidation to rally those who follow you into battle. You gain the following benefits:
- You can increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
- When a creature, other than yourself, that can see or hear you within 30 feet fails a saving throw to resist being charmed or frightened, you can use a reaction to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check against the save DC of the effect that caused that creature to be charmed or frightened. On a successful check, the target is no longer charmed or frightened.
