You have trained extensively with the crossbow and can use it more efficiently than most. You gain the following benefits:

- You can ignore the loading property of all crossbows.
- You can load a crossbow with a hand that is holding a one-handed weapon, shield, or another Tiny object.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with crossbows.
- When you take the Attack action and make an attack with a one-handed melee weapon, you can use a bonus action on that turn to make an attack with a hand crossbow.
