You have studied dastardly techniques to perform Devious Exploits. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two 1st-degree Devious Exploits of your choice from those available to the Alternate Rogue. If an Exploit requires the target to make a saving throw to resist it, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Exploit with another 1st-degree Devious Exploit of your choice.
- You gain two d4 Exploit Dice for your Exploits. An Exploit Die is expended when used. You regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
- If you have Exploit Dice from another source, you only gain one Exploit Die equal to your other Exploit Dice.
