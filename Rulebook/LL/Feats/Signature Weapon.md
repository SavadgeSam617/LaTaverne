Rather then master many weapons you have chosen to hone your skills with one. You gain these benefits:

- You can increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one type of weapon you are proficient with to be your Signature Weapon. When you make an attack with that type of weapon, its damage die increases by one size, as shown on the Signature Weapon table below.
- When you roll a 1 on the damage die for that weapon you can reroll the die. You must use this new roll, even if you roll a 1.
