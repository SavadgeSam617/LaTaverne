You have studied combat techniques that allow you to perform Martial Exploits. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two 1st-degree Martial Exploits of your choice from those available to the Alternate Fighter. If an Exploit you use requires the target to make a saving throw to resist the effects, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- You gain two d4 Exploit Dice to fuel your Exploits. An Exploit Die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest. If you already have Exploit Dice from another source, you only gain one Exploit Die equal to your other Exploit Dice.
