*Prerequisite: the ability to cast at least one spell*

You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

- When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use a reaction to add your Spellcasting modifier (minimum of +0) to your roll.
- You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or shields in one or both hands.
- When you make an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell instead. It must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 attack, and this spell can only target that creature.
- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell with a casting time of On Hit.
