*Prerequisite: Dexterity of 13 or higher*

When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack while you are wielding a finesse weapon you are proficient with, you can use a reaction to add your Dexterity modifier (minimum of +1) to your Armor Class against that attack.

If this bonus to your Armor Class would cause the attack to miss, you can make an attack with that finesse weapon against the attacker as part of the same reaction.
