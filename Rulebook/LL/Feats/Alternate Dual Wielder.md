You have trained extensively to effectively fight wielding two melee weapons at once. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
- You can engage in two-weapon fighting even if the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding are not light.
- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
- When you make an opportunity attack while engaging in two-weapon fighting you can make an attack against the creature with both melee weapons you are wielding.
