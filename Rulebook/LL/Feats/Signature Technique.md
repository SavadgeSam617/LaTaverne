*Prerequisite: At least one Martial Exploit Known*

You have practiced and mastered a single technique so you can use it at will. Choose one 1st-degree Exploit you know is on the Fighter's list of Martial Exploits that forces a creature to make a saving throw or deals damage.

Once on each of your turns, you can use this Signature Exploit, rolling a d4 in place of expending an Exploit Die.

You can choose this Feat more than once, however, you are always limited to one Signature Exploit per turn.
