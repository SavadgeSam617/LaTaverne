You are as skilled as one can be at exploring dungeons and disarming deadly traps. You gain the benefits listed below:
- You gain proficiency in your choice of either Perception, Investigation, or thieves' tools. Moreover, when you make an ability check using any of these proficiencies, you can treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
- You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or resist traps and are resistant to the damage dealt by traps.
- Traveling at a fast pace in a dungeon doesn't impose the normal penalty on passive Investigation and Perception scores.
