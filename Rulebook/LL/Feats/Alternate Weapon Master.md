You have trained to use the most potent armaments and weapons of war. You gain the benefits listed below:

- You increase either your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.3
- You gain proficiency in all simple and martial weapons.
- If you are already proficient with all simple and martial weapons, you can instead choose four types of weapons. Whenever you make a weapon attack with one of those weapons, you can treat a roll equal to your proficiency bonus or lower on the d20 as your proficiency bonus.
