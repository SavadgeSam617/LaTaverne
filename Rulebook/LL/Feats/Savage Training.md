You can draw upon the anger within your soul to perform Savage Exploits. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two 1st-degree Savage Exploits of your choice from those available to the Alternate Barbarian. If an Exploit you use requires the target to make a saving throw to resist the effects, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- Each time you gain a level, you can replace one of the Exploits you know with a 1st-degree Savage Exploit of your choice.
- You gain two d4 Exploit Dice to fuel your Exploits. An Exploit Die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
- If you already have, or gain any Exploit Dice from another source, you only gain one Exploit Die equal to your other Exploit Dice.
