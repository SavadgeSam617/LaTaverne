*Prerequisite: proficiency with a martial weapon*

You have trained to combine your minor magics with weapon attacks. You gain the benefits listed below:

- Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.
- You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Magus spell list, choosing Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these Magus Cantrips. At least one of these Cantrips must deal damage. 
- Once on each of your turns when you make a melee weapon attack, you can imbue the magic of a Magus Cantrip you know into your attack. On hit, you do not deal the normal damage of the Cantrip along with the damage of your weapon attack. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the Cantrip, and it applies the additional effects of the Cantrip on hit.
