You have studied and mastered monastic Techniques which allow you to perform supernatural feats of spiritual power.

- You learn two Techniques from the Alternate Monk class. If the Technique has a prerequisite or mentions a Martial Arts die, you can learn it only if you are a Monk and you meet its prerequisites. If a Technique requires the target to make a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.
- You gain 2 Ki Points to spend on Techniques. You regain all of your expended Ki Points when you finish a short or long rest. If you have Ki from another feature, these Ki Points are added to your total pool of Ki Points.
