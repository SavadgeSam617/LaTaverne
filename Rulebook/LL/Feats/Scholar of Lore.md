You have spent time learning everything there is to know about a specific area of study. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You master a Scholarly Pursuit of your choice from those available to the Savant. If the Pursuit has a Savant level prerequisite, you can learn it if your total level meets or exceeds the prerequisite level for that Scholarly Pursuit.
- If the Scholarly Pursuit requires that you roll an Intellect Die, you roll a d4 unless your Intellect Die is higher.
