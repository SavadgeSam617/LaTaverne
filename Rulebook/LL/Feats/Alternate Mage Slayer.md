You have trained extensively to counter sinister spellcasters and foil their arcane abilities. You gain the following benefits:
- When you can see or hear a creature within the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding cast a spell, you can make an opportunity attack against it. On hit, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if it were doing so to maintain concentration. On a failure, its spell fails to take effect, and its slot or use of that ability is wasted.
- If you damage a creature concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration. This does not stack with the first bullet.
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures you can see or hear within 5 feet of you.
