Your sheer physical might dwarfs that of nearly all other mortal creatures. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Whenever you make a Strength-based ability check you can treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
- You count as one size larger for the purposes of your carrying capacity, the weight that you can push, pull, lift, or drag, and for the size of creatures that you can attempt to grapple.
