Type: Metamagic
---
When you cast a spell that forces an Intelligence or Charisma saving throw, you can spend 3 Sorcery Points and change the spell's saving throw to target the other ability score instead.
This Metamagic only changes the initial saving throw. Any subsequent saving throws target the original ability score.
