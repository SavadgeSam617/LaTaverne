When you cast a Sorcerer cantrip you can expend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the power of that cantrip to its next level. For example, a 3rd level Sorcerer, can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast firebolt as if they were a 5th level Sorcerer, and that firebolt will deal 2d10 fire damage in place of 1d10.
