When you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to force one target of the spell to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it blinded for
one minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.
