When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to empower the casting. If you roll the highest number of any of the spell's damage dice you can roll that die
again and add it to the total damage. However, if you roll the lowest number on any of the spell's damage dice, you remove that die, and its damage, from the total damage of the spell.
