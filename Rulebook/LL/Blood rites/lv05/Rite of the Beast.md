Type: Blood rites
---
Prerequisite: 5th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you invoke this Rite as you touch a living beast, smearing a drop of your blood on its face. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become enthralled by you for 1 hour, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.

An enthralled beast is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your orders completely. In combat you share initiative and it acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction
on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use your bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block or another action. If you can ride the beast then it counts as a trained mount for the duration of this Rite.

You can only have one creature enthralled by a Blood Rite at a time. Attempting to enthrall another creature with a Rite instantly frees any other creatures you have enthralled.

###### Empowered Beast
The beast remains enthralled by this Blood Rite until the end of your next long rest.
