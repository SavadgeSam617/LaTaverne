Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 13th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you invoke this Rite and touch a live humanoid, smearing a drop of your blood on its face. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become enthralled by you for 1
minute, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.

An enthralled humanoid is friendly to you and obeys your orders completely. In combat it shares your initiative and acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own,
but it only takes the Dodge action on its turn unless you use your bonus action to command it to take one of the actions from its stat block or another action.

You can only have one creature enthralled by a Blood Rite at a time. Attempting to enthrall another creature with a Rite instantly frees any other creatures you have enthralled.

###### Empowered Thralldom.
The humanoid is enthralled by this Blood Rite for up to 1 hour.
