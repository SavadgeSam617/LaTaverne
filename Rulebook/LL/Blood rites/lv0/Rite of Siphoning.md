As an action, you can invoke this Rite and force one creature you touch to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Rite Die, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage taken by the creature.

###### Empowered Siphoning
The necrotic damage from this Rite is treated as the maximum possible amount instead of rolling.
