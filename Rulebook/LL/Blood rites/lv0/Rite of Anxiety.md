As a bonus action, you invoke this Rite and curse a creature you can see within 30 feet, making it susceptible to outside influence. For 1 minute, creatures of your choice who make
a Charisma check to influence the target can add one roll of your Rite Die to the result of their ability check.

The creature also has disadvantage on the first Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw it is forced to make before the end of your next turn.
