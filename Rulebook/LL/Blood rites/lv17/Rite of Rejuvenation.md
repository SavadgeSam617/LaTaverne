Prerequisite: 17th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you invoke this most powerful and ancient Rite and touch another living and willing creature, granting it an increase in stamina at the cost of its health. It instantly gains all the benefits of a short rest, including the ability to expend its Hit Dice to regain hit points. However, the maximum life span of the creature is permanently reduced by 1 year and 1 day, and it suffers 1 level of exhaustion.

Once your invoke this Blood Rite you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke it again. You cannot make a Vital Sacrifice to circumvent this once per rest restriction.
