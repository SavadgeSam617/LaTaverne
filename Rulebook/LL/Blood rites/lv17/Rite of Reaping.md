Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 17th-level Blood Hunter

As an action, you invoke this most powerful and ancient Rite and force creatures of your choice within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw as you draw all blood toward you. 

Creatures take necrotic damage equal to five rolls of your Rite Die on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

Any creature that you have dealt damage to since the start of your previous turn has disadvantage on this saving throw.

Once your invoke this Blood Rite you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke it again. You cannot make a Vital Sacrifice to circumvent this once per rest restriction.

###### Empowered Reaping
This Blood Rite ignores necrotic resistance and treats immunity as resistance. Any creatures killed by this Rite are reduced to a pile of flesh-colored dust.
