Type: Blood rites

Prerequisite: 9th-level Blood Hunter

As a bonus action, you invoke this Rite to force one creature that can see or hear you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened of you for 1 minute.

While frightened in this way, a creature must do all it can to move as far away from you as possible by the safest route that it can. If it cannot move it can take the Dodge action. If it can end its turn where it cannot see you, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effects of this Rite on a success.

###### Empowered Dread
On a failure, the creature is stunned for the duration, so long as it can see you. If it takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
