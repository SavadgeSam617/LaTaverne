As a bonus action, you invoke this Rite to force one creature that you can see within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded, deafened, and cannot speak
or make any sound for 1 minute. It repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

###### Empowered Senseless
The creature's speed is reduced to 0 for the duration along with the other effects of this Rite.
