This magic weapon ignores the loading property if it has it. If you load no ammunition into the weapon it produces its own, creating magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack. The ammunition vanishes after it either hits or misses.

At 11th level, this weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. 
This bonus becomes +2 at 17th level.
