This magical diamond is bonded to an arcane focus. When the wielder of this focus casts a spell that deals damage, it can change the spell's damage to acid, cold, fire, lightning,
poison, or thunder damage.

At 17th level, this magic arcane focus grants its wielder a +1 bonus to its spell attack rolls and its Spell save DC.
