5th-level Artificer

This magic suit of armor retains its weight but is formfitting and wearable under clothes without detection. It also grants its wearer advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

At 11th level, this armor grants its wearer a +1 bonus to Armor Class. 
This bonus increases to +2 at 17th level.
