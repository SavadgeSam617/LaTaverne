5th-level Artificer

When the wielder of this magic shield is hit by a melee attack, it can expend one Charge to force the attacking creature to make a Strength saving throw. Large or larger creatures have advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker is knocked back 15 feet in a straight line and falls prone.

This magical item has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.

At 11th level, this magic shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class. 
This Armor Class bonus increases to +2 at 17th level.
