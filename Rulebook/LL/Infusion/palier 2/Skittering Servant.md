5th-level Artificer

Your experimentation has created an arachnoid Skittering Servant. It is a Tiny mechanical construct with eight metallic legs. 

As an action, you can use your tinker's tools to attach (or remove) a single weapon or object to the Servant.

As an action, you can expend one of the Servant's Charges and throw it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 ft. where it activates. While it is activated, you can use a bonus action to order the Servant to move up to 20 feet and use the object attached to it as if you were using it. 
The Servant can move up walls and difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without having to make an ability check.
The Servant has hit points equal to your Artificer level and Armor Class equal to your Intelligence score. 
It is active for up to 1 minute or until it is destroyed, then it deactivates, instantly returning to its wielder.

This magic Servant has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.
