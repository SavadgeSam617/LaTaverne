5th level artificer
You have discovered the secrets to the creation of life. You learn the [[Clone]] spell. It counts as an Artificer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your total number of Spells Known.

You can cast [[Clone]] without expending a spell slot as long as you have the material components available. Your [[Clone]] only takes 12 days to reach maturity, but you can only have one.

If you replace this Infusion with another at any point before your [[Clone]] reaches maturity, the spell immediately fails.
