5th-level Artificer

As a bonus action, the wielder can cause this weapon to emit bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light 30 feet beyond that. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action. When the wielder hits a creature with this magic weapon, it can expend one Charge to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is blinded until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. This magical item has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn. 

At 11th level, this weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. 
This bonus increases to +2 at 17th level.
