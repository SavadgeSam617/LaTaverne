Upon Infusion, you choose a command word for this weapon.

As a bonus action, the wielder can speak the magic weapon's command word, expending one of its Charges. When it does so, the weapon begins to hover in its space, and attacks one target of its choice within 5 feet, using your Intelligence, in place of the wielder's Strength or Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls. 

While this magic weapon hovers, the wielder can attack with it using its bonus action on each turn. This magical weapon remains active for 1 minute, or until the wielder speaks its command word again, at which point it returns to its wielder's empty hand, sheath, or belt.

This magical weapon has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.
