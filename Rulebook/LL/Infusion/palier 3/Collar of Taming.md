11th-level Artificer

When worn by a beast with a CR equal to or less than your Intelligence modifier, this magical collar allows the creature attuned to exert absolute control over that beast.

The collared beast is friendly to you and obeys your orders completely. In combat you share initiative and it acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to order it to take an action from its stat block or another action. If you can ride the beast then it counts as a trained mount.

At 17th level, this magic collar can control mostrosities.
