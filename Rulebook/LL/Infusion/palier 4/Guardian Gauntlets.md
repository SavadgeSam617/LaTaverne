17th-level Artificer

When a creature ends its turn within 30 feet of the wearer of these magical gauntlets, the wearer can expend one Charge as a reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. Huge and larger creatures have advantage on this save. On a failure, it is pulled 30 feet
toward the wearer to an unoccupied space of its choice. If it pulls the creature within 5 feet, the wearer can make a single melee weapon attack against it. This magic item has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains
all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.
