17th-level Artificer

In place of an attack, the wielder of this magical object can make a ranged spell attack against a target it can see within 60 feet. On hit, the target takes 2d10 force damage.

As an action, the wielder can expend one Charge to fire two dimensional motes at two unoccupied flat surfaces that it can see within 60 feet, creating one 5-foot by 5-foot portal
that connects the two surfaces. 
This portal remains open for 1 minute, but it is closed early if five creatures pass through it, or if this Infusion is used to create another portal.

This magical object has a number of Charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Charge), and it regains all of its expended Charges each day at dawn.
