_Prerequisite: 4th Level, [[Squire of Solamnia]] Feat_

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Crown, a group that extols the virtues of cooperation, loyalty, and obedience. You excel in group combat and gain these benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- **Commanding Rally.** As a bonus action, you can command one ally within 30 feet of yourself to attack. If that ally can see or hear you, they can immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction. If the attack hits, the ally can roll a d8 and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attack's damage roll. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
