_Prerequisite: 4th Level, [[Squire of Solamnia]] Feat_

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Rose, a group known for leadership, justice, and wisdom. Your resolve grants you these benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- **Bolstering Rally.** As a bonus action, you can encourage one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself). If the target can see or hear you, the target gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the ability score increased by this feat. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
