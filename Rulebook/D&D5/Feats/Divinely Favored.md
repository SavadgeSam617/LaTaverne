_Prerequisite: 4th Level, Dragonlance Campaign_

A god chose you to carry a spark of their power.

You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[Cleric spell list]] and one 1st-level spell based on the alignment of your character, as specified in the Alignment Spells table below. You also learn the [[Augury]] spell.

| Alignment Spells |                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alignment        | 1st-level Spells                                           |
| Evil             | Choose one 1st-level[[Warlock spell list\| Warlock]] spell |
| Good             | Choose one 1st-level [[Cleric spell list\| Cleric]] spell. |
| Neutral          | Choose one 1st-level [[Druid spell list\|Druid]] spell     |

You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell and the [[Augury]] spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast either of these spells in this way again. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).

In addition, you can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses the spellcasting ability you choose when you select this feat.
