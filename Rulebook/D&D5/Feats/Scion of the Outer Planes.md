_Prerequisite: Planescape Campaign._

Your connection to an Outer Plane infuses you with the energy there. Choose a type of plane listed in the Planar Infusion Table. Your choice gives you a resistance to a damage type and the ability to cast a cantrip, as specified in the table. You can cast this cantrip without material components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
