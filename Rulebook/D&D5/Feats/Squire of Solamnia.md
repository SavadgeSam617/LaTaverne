Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen

_Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign, Fighter or Paladin Class or Knight of Solamnia Background_

Your training in the ways of the Knights of Solamnia grants you these benefits:

- **Mount Up.** Mounting or dismounting costs you only 5 feet of movement.

- **Precise Strike.** Once per turn, when you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can cause the attack roll to have advantage. If the attack hits, you roll a d8 and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attack's damage roll. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but a use is expended only if the attack hits. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
