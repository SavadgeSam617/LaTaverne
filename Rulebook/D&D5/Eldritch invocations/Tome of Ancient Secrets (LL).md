_Prerequisite: 3rd-level Warlock, Eldritch Tome_  
Your Eldritch Tome gains two new pages, each detailing one 1st-level ritual spell of your choice from any class spell list. These spells count as Warlock spells for you, but they don't count against your total number of Spells Known.

You can also mystically add additional ritual spells to your Eldritch Tome, so long as the ritual spell is equal to the level of your Pact Magic spell slots or lower. To do so, you perform a 1-hour ritual during which you burn one scroll detailing the ritual spell and 50 gp worth of incense per level of the spell. After which, a page detailing the spell appears in your Tome.
