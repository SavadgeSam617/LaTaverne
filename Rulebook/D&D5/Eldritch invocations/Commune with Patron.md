_Prerequisite: 9th-level Warlock_  
Your Pact advances, allowing you to communicate directly with your Patron. You learn _contact other plane_. You can cast it without expending a spell slot to contact your Patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's saving throw.

Once you cast _contact other plane_ in this way you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again.
