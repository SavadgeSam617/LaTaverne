**_Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Blade feature_**

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon counts as a magic weapon with a +3 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is already a magic weapon that you transformed into your pact weapon.
