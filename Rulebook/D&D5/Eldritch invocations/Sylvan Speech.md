You learn to speak Sylvan, and while speaking in Sylvan you can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, they can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived in the past day.

At 7th level, you can speak in Sylvan to communicate with plants as if you were under the effects ofÂ _speak with plants_.
