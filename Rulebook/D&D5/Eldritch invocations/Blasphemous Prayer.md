_Prerequisite: 5th-level Warlock, Eldritch Tome_  
A new page appears in your Eldritch Tome detailing a single Channel Divinity option of your choice from those available to any Cleric Divine Domain at 2nd level. You use your Warlock level and Spell save DC for Cleric level or Spell save DC.

You can invoke this Channel Divinity once, then you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke it again.
