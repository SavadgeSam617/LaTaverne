**_Prerequisite: [The Seeker](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:seeker-ua) patron_**

The Seeker bids you to travel in search of knowledge, and little can prevent you from waling this path. You ignore difficult terrain, have advantage on all checks to escape a grapple, manacles, or rope bindings, and advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed.
